# Nonparametric Analysis of US Dairy Production and Consumption

This project was developed for the course of "Nonparametric Statistics" held at Politecnico di Milano in the academic year 2022-2023.

We present a nonparametric analysis of the evolution of dairy production and consumption in the United States from 1980 to 2021. Nonparametric methods do not rely on assumptions about the underlying probability distributions of the data, making them useful for analyzing datasets with complex or unknown distributions. Through the use of statistical techniques such as frequency distributions, cross-tabulations, and trend analysis, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trends and patterns in the US dairy industry over the past 42 years.
